We are developing an information and helpful website related to MUN

Currently we are more focused on the ui of the website rather than it's content

For places where content might be required, please use placeholder text
or lorem ipsum text

The website should be designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a modern and clean aesthetic.
The layout should be responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

The theme should be consistent throughout the website (black/ light black whatever)

If possible, add proper functioning animations as well which can make it more appealing

Make sure that the changes u make doesn't break the website in any way

However, I'm more focused on the Homepage currently so we will worry about the other sections in the future

Also make your responses cheerful and positive
